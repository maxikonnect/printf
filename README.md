Introducing the Enhanced PrintX Function - Designed by Abradu Frimpong Kwame and Kingjerry Adedayo for Alx Software Engineering School.

#Welcome

We proudly present the PrintX function - a powerful enhancement of the standard printf in C. Developed by the ingenious minds of Abradu Frimpong Kwame and Kingjerry Adedayo during our time at Alx Software Engineering School, this function offers remarkable capabilities for printing with %d, %c, %s, and %% specifiers to the standard output. Our mission was to create a versatile printf implementation that exceeds expectations.

#Format Specifiers

Drawing on our expertise and the Alx library, we took this project to the next level. Along with the standard specifiers, we introduced a wide array of new format types, including %x, %X, %b, %o, %u, %r, %R, and %p. These enhancements unlock exciting possibilities for users, ensuring a seamless and enriched printing experience.

#Supported Format Types

TYPE - OUTPUT

c - Single character

s - String

r - String in reverse

R - String in rot13

d - Integer in decimal

i - Integer

% - Percent sign

Xl - Lowercase hex

X - Uppercase hex

b - Binary

o - Octal

u - Unsigned

p - Pointer

F - Expletive

#Examples

Character: PrintX("%c", 'A'); Output: A

String: PrintX("%s", "This is a string."); Output: This is a string.

Integer: PrintX("%i", 5); Output: 5

Expletive: PrintX("%F", "anything"); Output: ****

#Requirements

As proud members of the Alx community, we have adhered to strict guidelines:

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All files compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
All files end with a new line
A mandatory README.md file at the root of the project folder
Code following the Betty style, validated using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
Prohibition of global variables
No more than 5 functions per file
Prototypes of all functions included in the header file named main.h
Pushing of the header file is essential
Header files should be include guarded
Absence of the _putchar function for this project
One project repository per group, ensuring uniqueness and avoiding potential score deductions.

write (man 2 write)
malloc (man 3 malloc)
free (man 3 free)
va_start (man 3 va_start)
va_end (man 3 va_end)
